Coolant Flush

Every 30,000–50,000 miles or every 2–5 years.

Battery Replacement

Typically every 3–5 years; batteries should be checked annually.

Spark Plugs

Replace every 30,000–100,000 miles depending on plug type (Copper: 30,000 miles, Platinum: 60,000 miles, Iridium: 100,000 miles).

Timing Belt

Typically replaced every 60,000–100,000 miles or according to manufacturer recommendations.

General Car Care Tips

Tire Pressure

Check monthly; maintain recommended PSI (usually between 30–35 PSI).

Windshield Wipers

Replace every 6–12 months.

Lights and Signals

Inspect bulbs every 3–6 months; replace immediately if nonfunctional.

Fluid Levels

Check oil, coolant, brake fluid, power steering fluid, and windshield washer fluid monthly.

Seasonal Maintenance

Winter

Install winter tires where temperatures consistently drop below 45°F.

Ensure antifreeze concentration is correct.

Test the battery and charging system.

Summer

Verify air conditioning system is functioning properly.

Inspect coolant levels regularly.

Monitor tire pressures due to heat-induced variations.

Troubleshooting Common Issues

Car Won’t Start

Check battery connections; test battery charge; inspect starter and alternator.

Overheating

Check coolant levels; inspect radiator and hoses; ensure fan and thermostat functionality.

Poor Fuel Efficiency

Replace air filter; check tire pressures; inspect spark plugs; consider fuel system cleaner.

Fuel Types and Efficiency

Regular Gasoline (87 Octane): Suitable for most cars.

Premium Gasoline (91–93 Octane): Recommended for high-performance or turbocharged engines.

Diesel: Used for diesel engines; provides greater fuel economy.

Driving Habits for Improved Car Longevity

Avoid rapid acceleration and heavy braking.

Let your car warm up briefly (30–60 seconds) before driving.

Avoid excessive idling.

Emergency Preparedness

Keep jumper cables, tire jack, spare tire, tire inflator, flashlight, and first aid kit in your car.

Maintain an emergency contact list and roadside assistance information readily accessible.

Car Cleaning and Protection

Wash and wax regularly (every 2–4 months).

Interior cleaning every month to maintain upholstery.

Use windshield sunshades to prevent dashboard cracking.

By following these comprehensive guidelines, you can significantly enhance vehicle reliability, safety, and longevity.

General Car Knowledge

Engine: Converts fuel into mechanical power; types include gasoline, diesel, hybrid, and electric.

Transmission: Manages power from the engine to the wheels; types include manual, automatic, and continuously variable transmission (CVT).

Suspension: Absorbs road impacts, improves handling; common types are independent and dependent suspensions.

Brakes: Disc brakes and drum brakes slow or stop vehicle by friction.

Tires: Provide traction, affect handling, braking, and fuel efficiency; common types include all-season, summer, winter, and all-terrain.

Maintenance Basics

Oil Changes: Essential for engine health, lubricates internal parts, preventing overheating.

Tire Care: Check pressure monthly; proper inflation improves mileage and tire longevity.

Battery Care: Keep terminals clean, check regularly for corrosion, and ensure secure connections.

Brake Maintenance: Listen for squeaks or grinding noises; regular checks are crucial.

Car Parts and Functions

Alternator: Charges battery and powers electrical system when engine runs.

Radiator: Cools engine by circulating coolant.

Spark Plugs: Ignite fuel-air mixture; essential for smooth engine performance.

Filters: Oil, air, and fuel filters remove impurities, ensuring smooth operation.

Common Car Troubles

Dead Battery: Often caused by leaving lights on or faulty alternator; jumper cables required for quick restart.

Flat Tire: Usually due to punctures or leaks; carry spare tire and jack.

Overheating: Caused by low coolant levels, radiator leaks, or thermostat failure.

Brake Issues: Worn pads, low fluid, or damaged rotors are common culprits.

Driving Tips

Fuel Efficiency: Avoid rapid acceleration and excessive braking; maintain steady speeds.

Safety: Always use seat belts, follow speed limits, and minimize distractions.

Eco-Friendly Driving: Reduce idling, plan routes efficiently, and maintain regular tune-ups.

Emergency Essentials

Keep essentials like jumper cables, flashlight, first aid kit, and basic tools in vehicle.

Regularly inspect spare tire and emergency equipment.

Car Cleaning Tips

Regular washing prevents rust and corrosion.

Waxing protects paint from elements.

Interior cleaning maintains upholstery, prevents odors, and enhances comfort.

Seasonal Tips

Winter: Check antifreeze levels, use winter tires if necessary, maintain visibility with functional wipers.

Summer: Monitor coolant levels, ensure air conditioning effectiveness, protect interior surfaces from sun damage.
